This is BG6TOE, an amateur radio station from China.

I'm an Amateur radio operator since 2018, now class C operator in mainland China.

I'm now working on the "Matsuri-Contest-Log" project. However, it is far from usable yet. I'm also using it to test some new ideas. So the code might be mess. But I believe it will be a production level logging software one day.

**Notes about Logging**

- I do not upload my logs to QRZ.com logbook anymore.
- All logs will be uploaded to LoTW and personal online logbook. But they might be uploaded at a pretty low frequency.
- I will reply to all paper QSL cards. However, the post service is not good enough.
- Please send Email to qsl@matsu.dev if you want my paper QSL cards.
- QSL via Buro, LoTW, Direct mail.
